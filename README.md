**QuickPrint** is an autonomous print-shop management system designed specifically for college campus stationery shops. It automates the entire flow from document upload and payment to physical printing, allowing shop owners to focus on service rather than queues.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🚀 3-Click Print Flow**: Students upload, pay via UPI, and track their print status in real-time.
- **🛡️ Rock-Solid Reliability**: Local agent with durable SQLite queuing ensures jobs are never lost.
- **📦 All-in-One Installer**: Bundles the backend, student app, admin panel, and print agent into a single Windows application.
- **📊 Admin Control**: Real-time queue monitoring, financial reporting, and shop configuration.
- **🌐 Secure Remote Access**: Built-in Cloudflare Tunnel for secure student access without port forwarding.

## 🏗️ Architecture

For a deep dive into the system design, sequence diagrams, and resilience strategies, please refer to our **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

---

## 📜 Development Guidelines

- **Shared Logic**: Always put cross-app types and DTOs in `packages/shared`.
- **Database**: When modifying models, update **both** `schema.prisma` and `schema.sqlite.prisma`.
- **Print Agent**: Never modify `apps/desktop-app` without ensuring crash-recovery logic remains intact.
